    <div class="paragraf1" ><p><strong>Adele Laurie Blue Adkins</strong> MBE (/əˈdɛl/; born 5 May 1988), <br>
         is an English singer-songwriter. <br>
          After graduating from the BRIT School in 2006, <br>
           Adele signed a recording contract with XL Recordings. <br>
            In 2007, she received the Brit Awards Critics' Choice Award and won the BBC Sound of 2008 poll. <br>
             Her debut album, 19, was released in 2008. <br>
              It is certified 8× platinum in the UK and triple platinum in the US. <br>
               The album contains her first song, "Hometown Glory", <br>
                written when she was 16, which is based on her home suburb of West Norwood in London. <br>
                 An appearance she made on Saturday Night Live in late 2008 boosted her career in the US. <br>
                  At the 2009 Grammy Awards, <br>
